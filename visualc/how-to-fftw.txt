../../fftw-3.3.4-dll32 is the place to deploy the 32 bit version
of the fftw3 library under VC++ which can be found here:

 http://www.fftw.org/install/windows.html

More precisely,
 - you have to create the directory ../../fftw-3.3.4-dll32
    (which is side by side and thus outside of the ngspice source tree)
 - you have to fetch fftw-3.3.4-dll32.zip and deploy it there
 - you have to unpack this .zip there

At least you need to unpack these three files
  fftw3.h
  libfftw3-3.dll
  libfftw3-3.def

Then use vngspice-fftw.vcxproj to compile ngspice

If you need to distribute ngspice.exe to another directory,
copy libfftw3-3.dll into the same directory or to a place
which is in your PATH environment.
