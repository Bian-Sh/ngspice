README for PSPICE-compatible NGSPICE
==================

Due to very many commercial decive libs available as PSPICE compatible
descriptions, and due to the inclusion of ngspice into EAGLE and KiCad,
it is useful to enhance ngspice to PSPICE compatibility.

Items:
Add 'res' as resistor model type (in addition to 'r')
.model MyRe RES (R=100)

Add W (channel witdth) and L (channel length) to MOS1 (level=1) model
parameters.
